UW Bathrooms was a blog started by Aaron, Danny, and Zianna. Together, they went around campus trying different bathrooms, and wrote about their experiences.

The blog ran from 2012 to 2016 and captured the zeitgeist of UW during those years. In this archive, you’ll find period markers like the authors’ reactions to the newly renovated HUB and their thoughts on UW’s new gender neutral bathrooms. You’ll also find that certain things are timeless — from CHEM 142 and the struggle of completing ALEKS on Friday nights, to the jokes about frat boys and Paccar Hall.

While UW Bathroom’s reviews were few and far between, they were always interesting and funny. This archive is a dedication to the blog, and to the people who made created it.

To start things off, this blog lives and dies by the the following mantra: whenever you have to go to the bathroom, we know you’d much rather go to a clean, nice-looking one than a dirty one. This is where this website comes in. We go around campus, use all the bathrooms in each building, and report back with our experiences and opinions about them.  Ultimately, we want to come up with the best and worst bathroom in each building on campus. Why, you ask?  Let us start with asking you a question or two. Have you ever had to poop before/during/after a class and you picked a stanky-ass bathroom and it made your poop that much less enjoyable? Did some funny bathroom graffiti ever make you laugh out loud and make the guy standing by the urinal next to you uncomfortable? Did you ever wander around a building you’ve only been in a couple times trying to find a bathroom but got lost and couldn’t find it? Has bathroom anxiety ever paralyzed your lower intestine because farting around other people makes you embarrassed? Don’t lie, we know that shit’s happened to you before.

The bottom line is that you’re going have to go to the bathroom, so being armed with the knowledge of knowing where the cleanest, best-smelling, most secluded bathrooms are on campus could potentially make or break your experience. It might even save your life.

We are going to use the following method to determine the best and worst bathrooms on campus:

1. Choose a bathroom somewhere on campus that we haven’t previously reviewed.
2. Use said bathroom, qualitatively observing the categories of cleanliness, visuals/aesthetics, olfaction, traffic, and miscellaneous, as well as documenting the overall experience as inoffensively, but hilariously (if the experience permits) as possible.

We see a couple problems with this right off the bat. The first one we have identified is that we have no basis for reviewing women’s restrooms. The second problem is that our schedules will strongly bias which bathrooms we will tend to use the most. We hope to correct these problems by a) finding a girl to join our review board and b) be more adventurous with our bathroom selection in an attempt to capture the spirit of the website. And obviously we’re not going to post as much during any midterms and finals that we have. We also realize that we’re going to run out of synonyms and euphemisms for peeing and pooping at some point, so don’t get offended if we just refer to our “business” as such. Besides, using the words “pee” and “poop” are funnier than the politically correct terms.
