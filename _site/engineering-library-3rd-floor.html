					<p>I’m BACK IN THIS. You thought I slept on this blog didn’t you? The truth is, I don’t sleep anymore. All I do is take prolonged naps. You think I’m sleeping but then I sense a disturbance in my brain’s alpha waves and then BOOM I’m writing blog posts while in the meantime you’re taking pictures of your coffee foam the barista with thick-rimmed glasses frames made into a heart shape and posting all of them on instagram.</p>

<p>Every once in a while (maybe 3 or 4 times per academic quarter) I feel the need to be extremely productive, the desire to do so being fed by doing nothing for the previous three weeks. When this feeling hits me one of my go-to spots to crank out work is the Engineering Library. This is for numerous reasons. First, everyone that studies here is smarter than me, so I feel like I need to step up my academic game whenever I go here. Second, it’s probably the overall quietest building on campus. Pretty much the only noise you hear is mouse clicks or a group study session in one of the study rooms. The thing about their noise is that they’re actually studying as opposed to debating the attractiveness of the Franco brothers or watching Netflix on the TV’s (both of which are commonly observed phenomena in PACCAR and Odegaard). The study group right by me is trying to get everyone to use the Taylor series to do crazy engineering shit. Basically the Engineering Library has the “everyone here is smarter than me so I need to try to not be the dumbest, most unproductive person here” effect so I use it to my advantage.</p>

<p>The only catch with ELB is that the bathrooms are gender-segregated by floor; men’s restrooms are located on floors 1 and 3, while female restrooms are on 2 and 4. So obviously there’s no girls on the third floor and vice-versa for the second and fourth floors. This may not even be considered a hindrance to some people because studying with or in close proximity to the opposite sex is distracting. Right now some of y’alls might be thinking “Lol engineering girls are ugly they’re not a distraction” but just remember that they’re probably going to be a lot more successful than you when we’re all in our thirties. My biggest gripe with the men’s room being on the third floor is that I have to walk up two flights of stairs.</p>

<p>It’s a little tricky to locate as it’s on the other side of the floor from the stairwell. Once you walk in, you realize that this bathroom was made for efficiency. Six urinals in an alcove on opposite walls make for get-in-get-out usage. There’s a little privacy for the stalls, as they’re tucked away in a corner. Each sink has its own soap dispenser, which is such a small detail but it means that you don’t have to drip water in between sinks and get water all over the floor. The only caveat is that the paper towels are to the side of the sink area, so you’re going to get minor hand-drip floor saturation (abbreviated HDFS in academic circles).</p>

<p>Being that this is the Engineering Library, the layout of the building is functional and everything but I’m pretty sure Riker’s Island has nicer interiors than this place. The only updates this place has gotten since it was built is the installation of computers and a larger publication volume. Some might consider it drab but others would say that out of nothing comes everything.</p>
