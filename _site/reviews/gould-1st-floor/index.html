					<p>UW Bath­rooms has begun to wake up from its winter dormant the last couple days. The reasons for a lack of main­te­nance has been due to class­work and other extracur­ric­u­lars taking (forc­ing?) prece­dence this winter quar­ter, making it hard for me to write about new bath­room joints I stum­ble upon. I’m really hoping to see an increase in reviews but seeing how school and life has treated me the last few fort­nights (Re: Febru­ary, seri­ous­ly, fuck that month) I’m not going to get too opti­mistic. One can hope. Take these reviews as they come. Maybe I’ll get some guest posts from time to time; people have submit­ted some to me but given my one-sided rela­tion­ship with email they go unno­ticed. You don’t have a choice when you get a smart­phone though. It’s no excuse now. The stakes have been raised.</p>

<p>Gould Hall is nice because it’s far enough off campus that nobody’s really going to go there just to hang out or play Star­craft on public comput­ers but it’s also close enough to other build­ings, primar­ily south campus dorms, that it’s not completely isolated either. So anyone that goes there is typi­cally asso­ci­ated with the college of archi­tec­ture in some way, shape or form. It is usually bustling with human beings contain­ing border­line toxic amounts of stress hormones and caffeine in their blood­stream because of the 12,000 project dead­lines they’re trying to meet simul­ta­ne­ously so it’s usually not a place to go talk to and meet strangers unless you’re meet­ing your project group members, where you will see groups of three or four of them beer-bong­ing coffee and seething at the same time because they’ve been in the studio for the past 16 hours and CS5 crashed on them for the third time. So need­less to say it’s a good place to work on home­work by your­self if you’re around that part of campus. I would recom­mend study­ing in the library on the third floor. It has a neat view of downtown/Capitol Hill.</p>

<p>The build­ing itself is a cross between a construc­tion site and an Embassy Suites. It’s got the atrium thing going on and the struc­tures are made of concrete with wood panel­ing/ac­cents. Another touch is the stair­case span­ning over the atri­um. It’s a really cool build­ing but plebes will complain about how it’s too far to walk to get to the next stair­case to get to the next floor. I person­ally don’t mind it because that feature deters such complain­ers from coming back, making traf­fic in Gould constant but pleasantly light.</p>

<p>Possi­bly because the design­ers knew it would be some­what of a pain to get to the floor above or below you, they accom­mo­dated each floor with a restroom. The catch is that they are put in oppo­site corners of each floor, and on top of that, there is no rela­tion between the corner that they are in and floor they are on. Depend­ing on the entrance you use, it’s going to be a coin-flip as to what bath­room you’re going to use if you’re in a hurry. For conve­nience purposes I sought refuge in the men’s room on the first floor, which is located by the pain-in-the-ass coffee bar that WARN­ING: ONLY TAKES CASH.</p>

<p>The entire bath­room is red, which reminded me of <em>Carrie</em> when I first walked in. I felt slightly uncom­fort­able know­ing that there was a possi­bil­ity that it might have been a women’s restroom at one point, due to perpet­u­ated and rein­forced gender stereo­types regard­ing color asso­ci­a­tions and inte­rior design tech­niques with gender type. 2 seconds into using this restroom and it’s not look­ing good. This bath­room’s got me feel­ing guilty about having to think that I assumed it was a women’s restroom. What a male chau­vin­ist pig I am.</p>

<p>Things dras­ti­cally improved when i delved into the depths of the restroom. Gould M1, and as far as I know, all the men’s rooms in Gould, has a cool layout where the urinals and stalls are on oppo­site sides of a wall that look towards each other. A “hall­way” with sinks connects the two corri­dors. Urinals are on the right side of the wall and stalls are on the left. While the stalls are not entirely isolat­ed, it does reduce the amount of traf­fic that they are exposed to because they are kept away from the urinals, which means that all you private poop­ers poten­tially have a new quiet spot. The urinals are small and mini­mal­ist in design which are nice since I don’t like a big, impend­ing hunk of porce­lain to pee in. Urinat­ing is a deli­cate proce­dure for men. Urinal stalls are an added bonus. The sink area was pretty clean. Natural light supple­mented the airi­ness of the ambiance which made wash­ing my hands a pleas­antly relax­ing expe­ri­ence. By the way, if you don’t wash your hands after you pee, you’re gross as hell. Marie Curie, Louis Pasteur and Florence Nightin­gale all turn in their graves when some igno­rant simple­ton does­n’t wash their nasty ass hands after they touch their geni­tals and clean their buttholes.</p>

<p>While first impres­sions of the bath­room left me daunt­ing, the layout that encour­aged privacy left me feel­ing posi­tive about the expe­ri­ence. Gould may not be a place that you normally head to but you will have ample safe havens to go pee.</p>
