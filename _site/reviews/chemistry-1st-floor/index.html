<p>Chem­istry Build­ing is not to be confused with Bagley Hall. Both lie in the Drumheller Foun­tain region and are adja­cent to one another and both house a multi­tude of chem­istry labo­ra­to­ries but they are differ­ent enti­ties. I guess nobody donated enough money to the univer­sity or recently died and was famous enough to have a build­ing named after him/her­self so they stuck with the drab Chem­istry Build­ing. The main way to tell them apart is that the entrance of Bagley has a sick wall paint­ing fresco of ancient Egyp­tians doing trig prob­lems and chem­istry, and Chem build­ing does not.</p>

<p>I felt very out of place walk­ing down the hall­way to find the bath­room in Chem Build­ing because every­one was wear­ing lab coats and goggles. Which makes sense if you put two and two togeth­er. But I felt like I should have been wear­ing one too. It made me feel a little uneasy. Visit­ing the Chem Build­ing may be my excuse to wear my old lab coat and goggles and write stuff in my super expen­sive lab note­book that still has 95 percent of its pages blank. Can’t they make 15 page lab note­books instead of only sell­ing the 100 page ones for $50? It’s a huge waste of paper.</p>

<p>Chem Build­ing 1 was quite lavish. I guess the build­ing is rela­tively new because the bath­rooms still looked really clean and unused. It’s a really big spread, 6 urinals (with divider­s!) and 5 stalls. it was surpris­ingly empty, but maybe this was so because classes had just start­ed. I tried to look up when the Mersey­side derby was on my phone during my dumpy but the wifi was spot­ty. Maybe my phone is a piece of garbage, but this isn’t the place to browse the inter­net on the throne.</p>

<p>Other­wise Chem Build­ing was great. Apart from feel­ing like I was in a Resi­dent Evil movie walk­ing down the hall­way, this was a pleas­ant expe­ri­ence. Keep a mental note of this one, all you chem­istry majors. Ya’lls prob­a­bly knew about it but what­ev­er. Also, it’s only about a minute’s walk from the coffee shop in Bagley, which is certainly my only reason for going in there anymore. Thank God the Chem series is over.</p>
