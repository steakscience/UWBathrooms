<p>Chemistry Building is not to be confused with Bagley Hall. Both lie in the Drumheller Fountain region and are adjacent to one another and both house a multitude of chemistry laboratories but they are different entities. I guess nobody donated enough money to the university or recently died and was famous enough to have a building named after him/herself so they stuck with the drab Chemistry Building. The main way to tell them apart is that the entrance of Bagley has a sick wall painting fresco of ancient Egyptians doing trig problems and chemistry, and Chem building does not.</p>

<p>I felt very out of place walking down the hallway to find the bathroom in Chem Building because everyone was wearing lab coats and goggles. Which makes sense if you put two and two together. But I felt like I should have been wearing one too. It made me feel a little uneasy. Visiting the Chem Building may be my excuse to wear my old lab coat and goggles and write stuff in my super expensive lab notebook that still has 95 percent of its pages blank. Can’t they make 15 page lab notebooks instead of only selling the 100 page ones for $50? It’s a huge waste of paper.</p>

<p>Chem Building 1 was quite lavish. I guess the building is relatively new because the bathrooms still looked really clean and unused. It’s a really big spread, 6 urinals (with dividers!) and 5 stalls. it was surprisingly empty, but maybe this was so because classes had just started. I tried to look up when the Merseyside derby was on my phone during my dumpy but the wifi was spotty. Maybe my phone is a piece of garbage, but this isn’t the place to browse the internet on the throne.</p>

<p>Otherwise Chem Building was great. Apart from feeling like I was in a Resident Evil movie walking down the hallway, this was a pleasant experience. Keep a mental note of this one, all you chemistry majors. Ya’lls probably knew about it but whatever. Also, it’s only about a minute’s walk from the coffee shop in Bagley, which is certainly my only reason for going in there anymore. Thank God the Chem series is over.</p>
