					<p>What’s up everybody. Welcome back for another year of classes and whatever. This site will be picking back up by extension of me having to be on campus and, therefore, me having to find good bathrooms on campus. Since there’s going to be 40,000 more people at or around school than the last three months I figure some of y’alls will need to find suitable restroom spots also! Especially you freshmen that will all be taking 12 million person lectures for terrible classes like CHEM 142 in terrible places like Kane Hall and eating in more terrible places like the HUB and studying in the terriblest places like Odegaard at equally terrible hours of the day (or night). The point here is that there are a lot of terrible aspects to college (not just UW but pretty much all of them in general) that you’re not going to be able to avoid in any sort of way, but you should optimize all the variables you can control to make the rest of the terrible things a little bit less terrible. One of these important variables, in my mind, is where you go to the bathroom. If you really need to know all the reasons why, <a href="https://uwbathrooms.wordpress.com/2012/04/26/sup-uw/" title="Sup UW">read the intro post</a>, but I think it’s pretty self-explanatory.</p>

<p>We’re kicking 2014 off with the recently rebuilt Ethnic Cultural Center. This is located kind of a ways away from the main portion of campus by all the southern dorms that have been going up the last year or two. All the construction is pretty contemporary and stuff. That new technology-sustainability-urban-living sort of feel to it that is pretty much everywhere in Seattle now where they try to do unique cool designs but everything ends up looking more or less the same. But that’s another issue. Anyways it’s on the corner of Brooklyn and 40th.</p>

<p>The interior hasn’t really been broken in yet and everything’s still pretty sleek and shiny and not that dirty. I’m not really sure what all goes down at the Ethnic Cultural Center, aside from celebrating various cultures and ethnicities, but it’s I think that it’s less utilized than what they want it to be. Fortunately, those types of building attributes usually make for pretty good bathroom hunting material. New, underused buildings translate to good bathrooms. If this is an actual hunt, I would say an appropriate game comparison would be a water buffalo or a swordfish/marlin. They’re the swordfish of the bathroom game.</p>

<p>So these bathrooms are pretty nice! The surfaces are clean and the toilets themselves don’t have after-use residue around them and the toilet paper was in ample supply. As a bonus, they have the single person multi-use bathroom that has one toilet and a locking door right next to the gender-separated ones. I used the multi-use one first to take a big stinky dump and avoided much public scorn in the process. These are absolutely necessary if your digestive system is recovering from dangerously high coffee and/or Memo’s consumption. There’s also a vending machine for tampons that cost a quarter, for all the folks that have to experience menstrual cycles. Nice.</p>

<p>The men’s room is still clean and nice and everything, but there’s a couple issues. First, doesn’t the ECC host events and have a stage and everything? (At least the old one across the street did.) If that’s the case, why are there only two freaking urinals? And only one toilet stall? You can’t have more than four people in there at any given time, not that the bathroom itself is that small, but just because there aren’t enough receptacles to go around for much more people than that. There’s going to be a big, stupid line down the hallway into the foyer thing and then you’re going to have to bump into people in the bathroom and it’s going to be awkward. Why couldn’t they have just avoided all this by putting in maybe two more urinals and maybe another stall?</p>

<p>And what’s the deal with the soap dispensers? There’s two sinks in the sink area. The left one has a soap dispenser against the wall, but the right one doesn’t. So if you have the right sink and don’t want to look like a degenerate that doesn’t wash his or her hands after you go to the bathroom, you have to finagle your way around the person on the left to reach the soap dispenser and drip water all over the floor, go back to the sink to rinse all the soap off, and then drip more water on the floor to reach for the paper towels. This process get compounded in tediousness when there’s an event going on and there’s a rush to use the bathroom. Not that dripping water is gross or anything, but having water all over the sink tops and the floor just isn’t that clean looking, you know? Paper towel dispensers might be another thing but at least put the soap dispensers in a place that’s convenient for more than 50% of the sink users. You don’t even need to double the amount of dispensers, just move it in between sinks and boom, problem solved.</p>

<p>So a couple quick changes to these bathrooms and they’re all good. Does that mean you shouldn’t use them? Hell no. If I was an underclassman that had enough financial assistance to be able to live in the South Campus dorms, I’s definitely prefer to use the ECC bathrooms over the probably gross communal ones you share with your weird, unsanitary suitemates. It’s pretty much on the way to where all your classes are going to be anyway. Other than that and actually doing something at there, its location is kind of a breaker for me getting a lot of use out of this spot.</p>
