					<p>Vernon Louis Parring­ton Hall is one of the oldest build­ings on campus and houses the grad­u­ate school with arguably the vaguest acad­emic disci­pline in the univer­si­ty, Daniel J. Evans School of Public Affairs. While I with­hold my bad jokes about the School of Public Affairs, I will tell you that Mr. Parring­ton was the Univer­sity of Okla­homa’s first foot­ball coach and that Mr. Evans is a former Sena­tor and gover­nor (R-WA) in the 60’s. It can be assumed that the latter very much involved in several public affairs and is a fitting name­sake to the schools.</p>

<p>Parring­ton is located north of the World War II memo­r­ial cul-de-sac on Memo­r­ial Drive, right by the stairs between Kane and Odegaard. Since it’s the home to a grad­u­ate school the major­ity of students will rarely ever have a class there save for a very occa­sional human­i­ties class or quiz section that snags a room there. What its role is most of the time is that really old build­ing that’s not Denny Hall that every­one walks by but never ventures into. Entic­ing is the quaint coffee bar that’s usually hidden by a huddle of grad students discussing vari­ous public affairs, but it’s really not worth it; the line is usually long and it’s really not that great of coffee. They also close really early, around 4 or so.</p>

<p>Given that Parring­ton is one of the oldest build­ings on campus, I’m going to guess that it’s under­gone at least a couple reno­va­tions since its open­ing in 1902. Who knows what the second floor men’s room looked like in its orig­i­nal form? Perhaps only the likes of Daniel J. Evans himself would know, as he grad­u­ated from UW in 1948 and will cele­brate his 88th birth­day this year. When life gives you lemons, you make lemonade.</p>

<p>This was one of the stranger bath­rooms I’ve been to on campus simply because of the décor and the surreal atmosphere it exudes upon walk­ing in. The most notice­able trait of this bath­room is the stall made of what I believe was the white walls with black marbling. You don’t expect that sort of opulence when you walk into a bath­room. The size of the bath­room made the marble that much more notice­able; this room is small, contain­ing only one urinal and one stall. As I went to pee, I was look­ing down at the floor and noticed white hexag­o­nal tiles. But then I looked at the walls and they had really glossy white rectan­gu­lar tiles. Throw in the clouded windows oppo­site from the urinal and stall and that is sensory over­load! Too many textures are play­ing out simul­ta­ne­ously for this to be a relax­ing expe­ri­ence. And with how small it is, the room becomes that much more intense as every sensory input is concen­trated that much. I was getting a headache just stand­ing there wait­ing for the old guy that was just getting out of the stall to wash his hands in the lone sink.</p>

<p>When the old man moved out of the way to dry his hands, I finally got a look at wall with the sink mounted to it, I saw one of the strangest things I have seen in a bath­room in recent memory.</p>

<p>Could it be? A framed picture of clip art of toilets? In a bath­room? What is going on? I looked around in disbe­lief only to see the door of the marble stall made out of wood. This was just too much. Who on Earth comes up with this sort of deco­rat­ing scheme? This was either the work of a direc­tion­less inte­rior designer or a surre­al­ist genius. This bath­room is bril­liant. I will only say the major draw­back for this one is the long flight of stairs you need to climb (it is at the top of the left stair­case as you enter PAR). This should defi­nitely not be a go-to hotspot by any means but with how badly every­thing clashes and the really great toilet picture on the wall it’s too funny to not enjoy every now and then walk­ing along Memorial Drive.</p>
