					<p>Sup fools. It’s been a while since new post. Yes, I am aware of this. I’d like to do noth­ing more than research­ing for blog mate­ri­als, but that’s not how life works all the time. You hope to be able to do the things you for leisure as your actual job some­day. Some people have achieved this, but the vast major­ity of us don’t have that luxury avail­able to us in the present. There’s other oblig­a­tions in life; you gotta cover those bases before you can even start to have fun for your­self. A lot of people don’t even get to have fun ever because they have other prior­i­ties that take prece­dence. Lots of people are just miser­able all the time. Just keep doing you and it’ll work out even­tu­al­ly, some­times, you know? For me, I’ll admit this isn’t the first prior­ity on my list short­-term and long-term plans, but you gotta express your­self in some sort of outlet. When you keep all that stress and worry­ing in you for a long time you snap and then you catch some­thing reck­less and do some­thing you regret. I’ll prob­a­bly say 70% of crimes happen just because those people snap and have to do some crazy shit. The other 20% is corrupt law systems and false impris­on­ments and what­ev­er. But there’s some people that are just built crazy, so there’s not a lot you can do about some of those people. Just give them their outlets and hope they don’t kill anybody.</p>

<p>The first review of 2015 is graced by the first floor bath­room of Eagle­son Hall. Eagle­son is located off the main affair of campus, on the corner of 15th and 42nd. It looks like a castle buttress, sort of. This build­ing is initially very intim­i­dat­ing because they have numpads on all the exte­rior doors. I had some horri­ble econom­ics lecture there a couple years ago but I don’t remem­ber the doors having those features yet. You gotta imag­ine all sorts of crazy folks that hang out on the Ave try to do all kinds of shenani­gans near there so they’re just trying to forti­fy. You don’t want some drugged out dude going through all your acad­emic shit. So I imag­ine secu­ri­ty’s pretty tight nowadays.</p>

<p>Eagle­son happens to be the home of the Depart­ment of Speech and Hear­ing Sciences. I know some people that stud­ied that in college, so I know that it’s totally a thing, I just have no idea what sort of stud­ies this would entail. It’s this small portion of the acad­emic universe my satel­lite tele­scopes can’t take pictures of. No clue. The one thing I do know about SHS is that there are approx­i­mately 0% men in this field since every person in that build­ing except the secre­tary was female. This is good for those of us that fall in the (1) male and (2) need to go to the bath­room but you’re near the Ave and it’s before dark demo­graph­ics. You gotta imag­ine the female restrooms in there are a night­mare. The lines during pass­ing peri­ods must be all kinds of wack­ness. Sani­tary napkins every­where, you know? Those aren’t really my area of exper­tise though. I’m more well-­versed in the male and unisex vari­eties for sure.</p>

<p>I mean, the inte­rior of the 1st floor men’s room isn’t anything to write home about. It can be summed up in three words: beige and window­less. There’s a couple strate­gi­cally placed mirrors to make it look bigger, which it kind of does I suppose. There’s a urinal and a stall. I ducked into the stall and it was nice and spacious, not too dark and cavernous. This bath­room has a nice shelf addi­tion across from the sinks so you don’t have to fina­gle with your messen­ger bag or man purse or satchel or what­ever is in your hands that you can’t hold while you’re going to the bath­room or don’t want to put on the bath­room floor. It was clean and odor­less. Not much more you can ask out of a bath­room, except with the bonus of the afore­men­tioned 10000000000:1 female:­male ratio so you will never have to be afraid of being near a human being that produces more testos­terone than estro­gen while you’re poop­ing if you ever choose to do so here. Defi­nitely gonna stash this one in the mind palace for when I’m wander­ing about the Ave during daylight hours.</p>
