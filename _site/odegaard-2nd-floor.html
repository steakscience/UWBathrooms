					<p>Happy Dead Week to all.</p>

<p>It’s been a long time coming for a review on a bathroom in Odegaard, the infamous undergraduate student library. Built in 1973, a short time later it was revealed by Carl Sagan as being one of the most difficult places in the Solar System to be productive. There are more means of distraction within those confines than there are water molecules in the oceans. These are numbers of epic proportion we are talking about here. People have been known to become institutionalized after spending too much time trying to get him or herself to actually study. You get the point. Odegaard is a hellhole for myriad reasons. Why is this so? Was this always the case? Japanese scientists are trying to build supercomputers to handle the algorithms used to determine these factors as we speak and have been unsuccessful thus far.</p>

<p>Most UW students avoid going into Odegaard at all costs unless they absolutely have to. My reason for coming here was one of desperation — I needed to use Adobe CS6, which I can’t afford to have installed on my laptop, and my roommate chokes my connection speed if I try to torrent anything had I chosen to obtain it illegally. This left me with no choice, so off I went.</p>

<p>Basically, if you’re foolish enough to attempt to be productive in Odegaard, you put on headphones and drown out any and all background noise and try to work on something until you have to pee. When you reach the point of squirming in your seat and being 100% positive that if you don’t pee in the next 7 seconds you’ll wet yourself, then you hastily pack up your things, or ask your friends (which explains why you’re not studying) or, much more awkwardly, the girl studying next to you to watch your stuff as you rush to the nearest bathroom. In my case today I was on the second floor, so after three hours of intense photoshopping, I logged out of my clutch dual screen station and booked it to the bathroom to the left of the checkout desk.</p>

<p>Odegaard got an interior renovation last year to celebrate its 40th year of existence. This was much needed because the place was pretty shabby looking and the bathrooms ran par with truck stop gas stations in terms of quality. It was really a shock despite all the renovations being done that the bathrooms essentially remained unchanged. If Michael K. Young or any other member of the ad board had gone inside the 1st floor bathroom for more than 0.2 seconds they likely would have hired a demolition team to blow the thing up and start from scratch just to render that it extinct for the rest of time, but they didn’t because the administrative building has kickass bathrooms (one of which I reviewed a while back) and never had to bother, so now the new Ode bathrooms are virtually unchanged.</p>

<p>Needless to say I was incredibly disappointed with my experience in Odegaard 2. For one it’s small, with only two urinals, two sinks, and a stall. The other glaring issue is the fact that the urinals are in the direct line of sight from the door, so to compensate for this, a divider was installed to obstruct the view. This in turn makes an incredibly awkward urinal corral with a narrow enough entrance that you get uncomfortably close to passersby. It didn’t really smell that great either because it’s a small bathroom handling a large and constant stream of traffic day after day. It just doesn’t work.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, Odegaard is just a terrible place in general and its bathrooms are no exception, even after an extensive interior remodeling. There should be no reason for anyone to ever go in there unless you’re checking out a book. It’s loud and crowded and you won’t get work done due to the innumerable distractions at hand. The University of Washington has thirteen other libraries all across campus, and all of them are infinitely better than Odegaard as places to study. If you need to study until 2am then just do it at your house or don’t procrastinate. There’s no reason you should ever be here, unless you lack any shred self-respect (which explains why I’m here).</p>
